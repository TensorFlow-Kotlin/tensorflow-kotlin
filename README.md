# TensorFlow Kotlin

This library is a Kotlin API for https://www.tensorflow.org. It attempts to provide most of the functionality provided by the official Python API, while at the same type being strongly-typed and adding some new features. It is a work in progress and a project I started working on for my personal research purposes. Much of the API should be relatively stable by now, but things are still likely to change.

Please refer to the main website for documentation and tutorials. Here are a few useful links:
