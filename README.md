# TensorFlow Kotlin

This library is a Kotlin API for https://www.tensorflow.org. It attempts to provide most of the functionality provided by the official Python API, while at the same type being strongly-typed and adding some new features. It is a work in progress and primarily for research purposes.

Please refer to the main website https://tensorflow-kotlin.dev for documentation and tutorials. Here are some useful links to get started:
